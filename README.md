# Black-Hole-Visualization

Visualize the behavior of light and other objects in the solar system following the path of spacetime around a black hole in a 2D environment. Gravitational constant, mass of black hole and speed of light can be modified to alter the effect of black hole. Force exerted by black hole can be observed too.
